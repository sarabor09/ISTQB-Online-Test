## JIRA PROJECT
[JIRA SCRUM PROJECT](https://saboba9.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/IOT/boards/5)
This project is using JIRA tool for project management and defect traking following agile methodology SCRUM.


## TEST STRATEGY
This project adopts BDD Methodology for testing.

1. Functional test scenarios are defined for each user story before development using the Gherkin language, facilitated by the Test Management Tool Zephyr Scale for Jira.

2. Functional test scenarios are executed manually on both Desktop and Mobile platforms for each user story. Any encountered bugs are promptly logged on JIRA and linked to the respective user story and test scenario. Comprehensive test results are meticulously documented using Zephyr Scale.

3. Upon completion of each Sprint, a new release version is crafted, encompassing:

* Successfully completed user stories.
* Detailed reports of functional test results and bugs.


### TEST RESULTS
